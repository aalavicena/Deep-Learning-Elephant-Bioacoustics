# FYP-Project-Audio-Classification-of-Elephants-and-Non-Elephants-Sounds

This repository is provided as a supplementary material for Naufal Rahman Avicena's Final Year Project (FYP) titled "CNN-based Bioacoustics Classification of Elephant and Non-Elephant Sounds".

This repository consists of the main codes for our study. 

Part of the codes were adopted from several repositories:
